# Operational Analysis of Photogrammetry

A modern web application built with React and Node.js, featuring real-time collaboration and advanced data visualization.

## Overview

Project Alpha represents a comprehensive solution for team collaboration in data-intensive environments. Built with modern web technologies, it provides real-time synchronization, advanced analytics, and intuitive user interfaces that make complex data accessible to all team members.

## Challenge

The main challenge was creating a system that could handle real-time data updates while maintaining performance and user experience across different devices and network conditions.

## Solution

We implemented a WebSocket-based architecture with optimistic updates and conflict resolution, paired with a responsive design system that adapts to various screen sizes and interaction methods.
